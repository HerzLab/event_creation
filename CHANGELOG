UPCOMING
=========
* Added brainshift-corrected MNI coordinates to localization
* Fixed bug in which event pipeline would crash if electrode config file didn't have a name
* Added call to brain visualization API at end of localization pipeline
* Updates to PS4 experiment suite:
    - all_events.json now created for PS4 experiments
    - PS4_* now their own set of experiments
    - anode_label,cathode_label,anode_num,cathode_num,amplitude fields moved from top level of PS4 events to stim_params

2017-12-5
=========
* Added some data quality checks to FR,catFR,PAL events
  - functions defined in quality module
  - parser registers the functions it wants to run in the class attribute _TESTS
  - error messages added to self.pipeline.importer.warnings in EventCreationTask
  - Importer now has warnings attribute, with corresponding changes to Importer.display() and ImporterCollection.display()
* Parsers now crash if they are missing annotation files

==========

- Some subjects were missing channels of EEG data. This has been resolved.
- Stimulation voltage in PS was sometimes reported in uA, and sometimes in mA.
  Now they will all be in uA
- PS events were occasionally out of order

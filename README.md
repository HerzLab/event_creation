To install dependencies:

    Install anaconda or miniconda (https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
    conda install scipy
    conda install mayavi
    pip install nibabel
    
    I think that's all, but I may be forgetting a depedency.

    After installation (if not on rhino) set the path to mounted rhino in config.py

    python test_snap_coordinates.py <subject>
